About CMSIS
===========
This folder contains the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard
(CMSIS) V4.3.0, which provides a single standard across all Cortex-Mx
processor series vendors. It enables code re-use and code sharing across
software projects and reduces time-to-market for new embedded applications.


Licensing
=========
CMSIS is released under the terms of the end user license agreement
("CMSIS_END_USER_LICENCE_AGREEMENT.pdf"). Any user of the software package
is bound to the terms and conditions of the end user license agreement.


Documentation
=============
To reduce the size of the distribution, the Documentation sub-folder from
the original distribution has been removed. However, the CMSIS-RTOS RTX
documentation is available online at:

http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/CMSIS/General/html


RTOS Libraries
=============
The RTOS part of the CMIS V4.3.0 has been copied to the separate directory
CMSIS_RTOS in the "3rd_party" folder.
