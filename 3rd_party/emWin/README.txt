
***
NOTE: This directory does not actually contain emWin, because of
the licensing restrictions put forth by SEGGER, which expressly
forbid re-distribution of the emWin software.
*** 

Instead, this directory provides a placeholder for the SEGGER emWin.
To be able to build and modify the provided QP-emWin demos, you need
to  download the "emWin Simulation & Trial version" from SEGGER
(https://www.segger.com/downloads/emwin) and yo need to install
it in this directory.

After the installation of emWin, this directory should contain the
following sub-directories and files:

<qp>
  +-3rd_party     
  | +-emWin        - this directory
  | | +-GUI        - GUI includes and pre-compiled libraries
  | | +-Simulation - emWin simulation on Windows libraries
  | | +-. . .      - other sub-directories and files
  | | +-README.txt - this README file
