      <h2>Version 5.02 [26. Jun 2018]</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>New Features</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>New API function OS_STAT_AddLoadMeasurementEx() added.<br>
            OS_STAT_AddLoadMeasurementEx() allows to set an application defined stack and stack size for the CPU load measurement task.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Improvements</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Under specific circumstances an unnecessary task switch could occur when using Round Robin.<br>
            This is no functional issue but has been improved for efficiency.<br>
            The issue existed in all previous embOS versions and is improved with version 5.02.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Program corrections</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>OS_Error() could be linked into the output although the embOS debug feature is disabled.<br>
            This is not a functional problem but could cause a minimal higher RAM and ROM usage.<br>
            The RAM usage increased by around 2-4 bytes and the ROM usage by around 40 Bytes.<br>
            The problem existed since embOS version 4.36 and is fixed with version 5.02.
          </li>
          <li>An issue with OS_TASK_SetPriority() could cause problems with other API functions when they are called from an interrupt routine:<br>
             OS_TASK_SuspendAll() does not suspend the task for which the priority is modified.<br>
             OS_TASK_ResumeAll() does not resume the task for which the priority is modified.<br>
             OS_STAT_Sample() does not calculate the task exec time for the task for which the priority is modified.<br>
             OS_TASK_GetNumTasks() returns the wrong number of tasks.<br>
             OS_TASK_IsTask() considers the task for which the priority is modified as non-existant.<br>
             OS_TASK_Index2Ptr() may return the wrong task control block.<br>
             embOSView temporarily displays wrong task information.<br>
             This issue occurs only when OS_TASK_SetPriority() is interrupted by an interrupt routine which calls one of above API functions.<br>
             The problem existed in all previous embOS versions and is fixed with version 5.02.
           </li>
           <li>OS_WD_Check() could trigger the reset callback function altough the timeout did not expire.<br>
             This issue can occur on 8/16 Bit CPUs under specific circumstances only.<br>
             The problem existed since embOS version 4.32 and is fixed with version 5.02.</li>

      <div>
        <h3>New Features</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>embOS V5 introduces a new simplified API name scheme which improves the usability.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Improvements</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>OS_SEMAPHORE_Give(), OS_SEMAPHORE_GiveMax(), OS_SEMAPHORE_GetValue(), OS_SEMAPHORE_Take() can now also be called from software timer.</li>
          <li>The extended task context is no longer restored when a task starts for the first time and it was set by OS_SetDefaultTaskContextExtension().</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Program corrections</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Under specific circumstances, a task was not executed after a priority inheritance was performed.<br>
            The problem did occur only when all of the following conditions were met:<br>
            a) A resource semaphore is used by at least two tasks and priority inheritance occurs.<br>
            b) There is at least one more task with higher priority than the inherited priority, and that task gets ready for execution by an interrupt before the task running on priority inheritance releases the resource semaphore.<br>
            This issue is very unlikely and happens only when the scheduler is interrupted at a certain point by an interrupt handler.<br>
            This issue existed since embOS version 4.40 and is fixed with embOS version 5.00.

        <h3>New Features</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Trial limitation removed. embOS trial editions no longer stop functioning after a predefined run-time. This allows the usage of embOS trial editions for any non-commercial or educational purpose without any technical restrictions (while governed by the accompanying license conditions).</li>
          <li>Modified watchdog reset callback to take one parameter. This allows for investigation of the violated watchdog condition.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Improvements</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Added debug checks for zero-size messages to OS_Q_Put[Ex](), OS_Q_PutBlocked[Ex]() and OS_Q_PutTimed[Ex]().</li>
          <li>Added debug checks for zero-period software timers to OS_CreateTimer[Ex]() and OS_SetTimerPeriod().</li>

        <h3>Program corrections</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Under specific circumstances, tasks were not executed after being involved in a priority inheritance.<br>
          The problem did occur only when all of the three following conditions were met:<br>
          a) Round Robin is disabled, which is true in OS_LIBMODE_XR library mode, or when working with embOS source code and configuring the compiler define OS_RR_SUPPORTED to 0.<br>
          b) A resource semaphore is used by at least two tasks and priority inheritance occurs.<br>
          c) There is at least one more task with lower priority than the inherited priority, and that task gets ready for execution before the task running on priority inheritance releases the resource semaphore.<br>

          <li>New API functions OS_MPU_SanityCheck() and OS_MPU_AddSanityCheckBuffer() added which are used in certified embOS-MPU</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Improvements</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>embOSView communication module improved.<br>
            embOSView was limited to around 60 tasks in the task list window. embOS can send now information about much more tasks.<br>
            For this purpose the embOS communication buffer needs to be increased which is possible with the embOS source code only.</li>
          <li>embOS debug improved.<br>

            The problem existed since embOS version 4.34 and is fixed with version 4.36.</li>
          <li>OS_Q_PutBlocked(), OS_Q_PutBlockedEx(), OS_Q_PutTimed(), OS_Q_PutTimedEx() corrected.<br>

          <li>Reset behaviour of OS_EVENT objects can be controlled.<br>
            The new API function OS_EVENT_SetResetMode() allows setting of the reset behaviour of existing event objects.<br>
            The embOS functions for event objects unfortunately were inconsistent in respect of the reset behaviour of events.<br>
            Setting the reset mode with the new function OS_EVENT_SetResetMode() allows to set the reset behaviour to semiauto, manual, or automatic reset.<br>
            Manual reset guaranties that the event object remains set when waiting tasks are resumed. The event has to be reset manually by the task.<br>
            Automatic reset allways resets the event when waiting tasks are resumed. The task does not need to reset the event.<br>
            The semiauto mode is the mode used in previous versions of embOS as described in the manual.</li>
          <li>New extended function for event object creation.<br>
            The new function OS_EVENT_CreateEx() allows to create an event object and set the reset behavior to semiauto, manual or automatic reset.</li>
          <li>Type of reset behaviour of event objects can be retrieved.<br>
            The new function OS_EVENT_GetResetMode() retrieves the current setting of the reset behaviour of an event object.</li>
          <li>Message size for mailboxes enlarged.<br>
            Previous version of embOS allowed message sizes of up to 127 bytes for mailboxes.<br>
            Now embOS allows messages sizes of up to 32767 bytes for mailboxes.<br>
            However, the total size of one mailbox buffer is still limited to 64KBytes on 16bit CPUs.<br>
            The debug builds of embOS now call OS_Error() with error code OS_ERR_MB_BUFFER_SIZE if the total size limit of one mailbox buffer is exceeded when calling OS_CreateMB().</li>

          <li>embOS heap management functions corrected.<br>
            Locking the heap by a resource semaphore must not be controlled by OS_IsRunning(). The previous implementation did not use (and initialize) the semaphore as long as embOS was not started.<br>
            This caused a problem when data was allocated during main(), without semaphore, but released from a task, which then addressed the semaphore which did not exist.<br>
            When OS_malloc() was not called from main(), the problem did not occur.<br>

        <ol>
          <li>embOS scheduler corrected.<br>
            The scheduler failed when a task which was suspended and on timeout reached its timeout and at the same moment during execution of the scheduler, a higher priority task was activated by an interrupt.<br>
            The higher priority task was put in ready state, but was not started.<br>
            The problem existed in all previous embOS versions and is fixed with version 3.86m.</li>
          <li>OS_TerminateTask() corrected.<br>
            Setting OS_pActiveTask, the pointer to the task to activate next, has to be an atomic operation.<br>
            To ensure atomic operation, interrupts have to be disabled before setting OS_pActiveTask when OS_PTR_OP_IS_ATOMIC is defined to 0. This was not handled correctly in previous versions of embOS and might have caused problems with CPUs which can not write pointer values as atomic operation. Most likely, all 32bit CPUs can write a pointer value as an atomic operation. The problem might have occurred on those 16- or 8-bit CPUs which can not. The problem is fixed with version 3.86m.</li>
          <li>Internal function OS_InsertTask() corrected. Insertion of a task into the linked list of tasks has to use atomic operations, when the next pointer of the previous task is updated to point to the new task that shall be inserted.<br>
            The corrected version disables interrupts before the next pointer of the previous task is updated, when OS_PTR_OP_IS_ATOMIC is defined to 0.<br>
            This was not handled correctly in previous versions of embOS and might have caused problems with CPUs which can not write pointer values as atomic operation, when tasks were created dynamically when embOS was already started, or OS_SetPriority() was called after starting embOS. Most likely, all 32bit CPUs can write a pointer value as an atomic operation. The problem might have occurred on those 16- or 8-bit CPUs which can not. The internal function OS_InsertTask() is called during task creation or OS_SetPriority().</li>
          <li>Definition of OS_VERSION corrected. The definition of OS_VERSION was modified with version 3.86l of embOS to comply to MISRA rules.<br>
            As long as OS_VERSION was used internally in embOS, no problem occurred.<br>
            Unfortunately, when user software tried to evaluate OS_VERSION for comparison, the expression could not be evaluated, compilation stopped with errors. The problem exsisted in version 3.86l of embOS only and is fixed with version 3.86m.</li>

            When embOS was compiled with optimization using IAR RX compiler the execution of the incrementation of region counter was delayed in OS_EnterNestableInterrupt().<br>
            The new macro OS_IntEnterRegion is now used in OS_EnterNestableInterrupt().<br>
            This macro can be overwritten in the cpu/compiler specific header file with OS_EnterRegionFunc() to avoid that interrupts are enabled before the region counter is incremented.</li>

        <ol>
          <li>OS_EVENT handling with timeout corrected.<br>
            Previous versions of embOS lost an event when tasks were waiting on the event by a all of OS_EVENT_WaitTimed() and the event was signaled after the timeout expired.<br>
            When the waiting tasks were not activated by the scheduler when the timeout expired, which might have happened, when an other task ran in a critical region, a following call of OS_EVENT_Set() did not signal the event, so the event got lost.<br>
            The waiting tasks reported a timeout when they continued execution.<br>
            The problem existed in all revious versions of embOS and is fixed with version 3.86h.</li>

        <ol>
          <li>Task events default to 32bit on 32bit CPUs.<br>
            The default for task events for 32bit CPUs was modified from unsigned char to unsigned long.<br>
            On 32bit CPUs, now the type OS_TASK_EVENT is defined as OS_U32 per default, allowing 32 different task events.<br>
            All previous versions limited the task events for all CPUs to 8bit per default.</li>
          <li>OS_ON_TERMINATE_HOOK added.<br>
            embOS now supports a linked list of functions which are called when a task is terminated.<br>
            The new embOS function OS_AddOnTerminateHook() can be used to insert a callback function in the list of functions which are called when a task is terminated.<br>
            The callback function gets the task ID as paramter.<br>
            The callback function can be used to free or remove task specific objects which were created by the application.</li>

        <h3>Program corrections</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>OS_ERR_TIMESLICE removed.<br>
            Previous versions of embOS called the error handler OS_Error() with error code OS_ERR_TIMESLICE, when a task with a timeslice value of 0 was created.<br>
            Now, a timeslice value of zero is legal. It allows pure cooperative scheduling between tasks with th esame priority as described in the generic manual, chapter 4.<br>
            The OS_ERR_TIMESLICE assertion was introduced with embOS version 3.82n and is removed with version 3.86f.</li>

          <li>OS_malloc(), OS_free(), OS_realloc() modified.<br>
            To allow thread safe heap management, OS_malloc() creates or uses a semaphore when called.<br>
            The new versions of OS_malloc(), OS_free() and OS_realloc() use the semaphore when called from tasks only. The semaphore is not needed, before embOS is started.</li>

            The API function macros were not defined properly in the release build.<br>
            When used in an application with relase build, the following functions generated compiler errors and could not be used: <br>

          <li>Timeout handling for waitable objects corrected.<br>
            When the timeout had already expired when the wait function with timeout was called, the function came back with interrupts disabled. This might have happened when other tasks with higher priority or interrupts blocked the calling task right after calling a wait functing. The application might have been kept blocked for ever when the calling task did not call any other function which re-enabled interrupts by OS_RestoreI().

      <div>
        <h3>New Features</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Timeout handling for "waitable" objects modified.<br>
            Previous versions of timed wait functions for waitable objects might have returned with no timeout condition when the object became avaialble after the timeout time.<br>
            This happened when the waiting task was blocked by higher priority tasks and did not start after the timeout period.<br>
            When the object became availabel after expiration of the timeout time but before the waiting tasks started again, no timeout condition was signaled to the task.<br>
            This behaviour is changed with version 3.86 of embOS. When the object was not avaialble within the timeout time, a timeout is signaled to the waiting task, regardless the object may become avaialble until the task runs again.<br>
            Following functions were modified:<br>
            OS_EVENT_WaitTimed()<br>
            OS_GetMailTimed()<br>
            OS_MEMF_AllocTimed()<br>

        <ol>
          <li>Support for task events with timeout corrected.<br>
            Previous versions of the functions OS_WaitEventTimed() and OS_WaitSingleEventTimed() limited the number of task events to 8, even when the definition of the type OS_TASK_EVENT was defined to a larger data type.<br>
            Because of an error in an internal function, task events were truncated to 8 bit, regardless the definition of OS_TASK_EVENT.<br>
            The problem existed in all previous versions of embOS and is fixed with version 3.86</li>

            On 8 or 16 bit CPUs with high interrupt load, the scheduler might have failed when an interrupt occurred during a resource semaphore with waiting tasks was released by a call of OS_Unuse().<br>
            This happened on CPUs which could not perform atomic pointer or 32bit operations.<br>

            During initialization, a default dummy handler is installed for all interrupt sources. This handler should normally be replaced by installing application specific interrupt handlers.<br>
            Because the default dummy interrupt handler should never be called by an application, it calls OS_Error() with the new error code OS_ERR_ISR_NO_HANDLER to signal the setup error.</li>

          <li>OS_STACK_ALIGN implemented.<br>
            OS_STACK_ALIGN may be defined to ensure a specific task stack alignment during task creation.<br>
            To ensure a stack alignment of 8 bytes, OS_STACK_ALIGN has to be defined to 8 in the CPU specific embOS internal header file OS_Priv.h.<br>

          <li>OS_TICK_Config() and OS_TICK_HandleEx() implemented.<br>
            The extended embOS tick handler was modified to handle a runtime configurable tick increment and fractions.<br>

        <ol>
          <li>OS_ERR_WRONG_STACK error code added.<br>
            Some ports of embOS for CPUs with different stack pointers require that the CPU enters main() with a specific stack selected.<br>
            These ports of embOS now contain code to examine the stack used in main and call OS_error() with the new error code OS_ERR_WRON_STACK, if the startup code entered main with the wrong stack-pointer selected.</li>

            OS_EVENT_Create() might have called the error-handler OS_Error() with errorcode OS_ERR_2USE_EVENTOBJ if an event-object was created dynamically or as a local object in a function.<br>
            This happened, if the un-initialized data area of the event object contained one specific byte (id code) of the event object.<br>
            The problem existed in all previous embOS versions and is fixed with version 3.60e.</li>
          <li>embOSView corrected.<br>
            When the update interval of embOSView was set to 200ms or a longer value, the reaction of user input or mouse events was blocked for the same time.<br>

            Individual flags for different peripherals may be set whenever a peripheral needs power or clock, and may be reset, when power is not needed.<br>

          <li>New error handling for version without round robin scheduling.<br>
            In debug versions of embOS, OS_Error() is called with error code OS_ERR_TASK_PRIORITY, if a task is created with a priority which is already assigned to an other task.<br>
            OS_Error() is also called with the same error code, if a task priority is assigned by call of OS_SetPriority() and the new priority is already assigned to an other task.<br>
            Round robin switching can be disabled by recompiling sources with OS_RR_SUPPORTED defined as 0.</li>

          <li>OS_Suspend() corrected.<br>
            OS_Suspend() did not work correctly, when the current task was suspended from within an interrupt handler, or from a critical region.<br>
            The application crashed, or called the embOS error handler OS_Error() with error code OS_ERR_INV_TASK (128).<br>
            As OS_Suspend() automatically enters a critical region in debug-trace builds, OS_Suspend() also failed, when it was called to suspend the current task in debug-trace builds of embOS.<br>
            This problem existed in all previous embOS versions and is fixed with version 3.28p.</li>
          <li>Alignment problems fixed for fixed size memory blocks<br>
            Some CPUs, mainly the 32bit RISC types, require aligned buffer start addresses for fixed size memory pools.<br>
            The debug version of embOS now checks alignment of buffer start address and data blocks in the buffer. If data blocks and buffer start address is not aligned, an error is generated and embOS error handler is called during creation of a fixed size memory pool.<br>

      <h2>Version V3.10q  [12. Jun 2003]</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Improvements</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>OS_CreateTask now initializes profiling variables. (Required if TCB is used multiple times)</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Program corrections</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>OS_GetMail().<br>
            OS_GetMail functions corrected (interrupts disabled before call of _GetMail).</li>
          <li>OS_Terminate problem with RR.<br>
            OS_Terminate problem with RR tasks corrected. TimerTick could set RR/PP pending between UNMARKTASK and OS_Switch. OS_Switch will then call OS_DoRR, which could append OS_pCurrentTask (the one you want to terminate if e.g. OS_Terminate(NULL)).</li>

      <div>
        <h3>Program corrections</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Sample interrupt handler.<br>
            For embOS it is not legal to call OS_EnterInterrupt again after final call of OS_LeaveInterrupt has been made. In the sample OS_irq_handler shipped with embOS, there was a possible call of OS_EnterInterrupt after OS_LeaveInterrupt. The sample OS_irq_handler implementation has been corrected.</li>

      <h2>Version V3.06h  [24. Oct 2001]</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Program corrections</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>OS_Unuse error code corrected.<br>
            When calling OS_Unuse() more often than OS_Use(), the debug version generated an OS_ERR_TASKLIST_CORRUPT error instead of OS_ERR_UNUSE_BEFORE_USE.<br>
            This problem exists in all previous embOS versions and is fixed with version 3.06h.</li>

      <h2>Version V3.06f  [24. Oct 2001]</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>New Features</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>OS_Use now returns a value.<br>
            When using a resource semaphore with a call of OS_Use(), the actual usage counter of the requested semaphore is returned as integer value.<br>
            This may be helpful for some applications and is a lot more efficient than calling OS_Use() and then check the usage counter by calling OS_GetSemaValue().</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Program corrections</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Round Robin Task Problem corrected.<br>
            In very specific situation it was possible that a round robin task got 100%
            of CPU time for round robin tasks instead of sharing that time with other
            round robin tasks.</li>
