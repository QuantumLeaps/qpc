## Closed Source Projects

If you are developing and distributing traditional closed source QP/C
applications, you can purchase one of Quantum Leaps commercial licenses,
which are specifically designed for users interested in retaining the
proprietary status of their code. All Quantum Leaps commercial licenses
expressly supersede the GPL open source license. This means that when you
license our QP frameworks under a commercial license, you specifically
do not use the software under the open source license and therefore you
are not subject to any of its terms. Commercial licensing options are
described at:
