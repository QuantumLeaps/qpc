Quantum Leaps Commercial Licenses

Copyright (C) 2005 Quantum Leaps, LLC <https://www.state-machine.com>

Quantum Leaps commercial licenses are traditinal closed-source, paid-for
licenses designed for licensees interested in retaining the proprietary
status of their code.

The Quantum Leaps commercial licenses expressly supersede the GPL open source
license. This means that when you license the QP/C or QP/C++  Real-Time
Embedded Frameworks under a Quantum Leaps commercial license, you specifically
do not use the software under the open source license and therefore you are
not subject to any of its terms.

Quantum Leaps commercial licensing options are described below:


Single Product License
----------------------
Single Product License allows a given company (“Licensee”) to embed the
specified type(s) of the QP Real-Time Embedded Framework(s) into one end-
product of the Licensee (Single Product). Licensee can distribute/sell an
unlimited number of units of the Single Product (royalty-free licensing),
for the life of the Single Product. A different Single Product license is
required for each different end product (i.e. model) even if the end-product
is in the same family as a previously licensed end product. This license
is specific to the Licensee and the name and model of the Signle Product,
which needs to be defined in the license. The general rule we apply is:

If you consider it a separate product…so do we!

Volume discounts are offered if several Single Products are licensed at once
with one license agreement.

specified type(s) of the QP Real-Time Embedded Framework(s) into any number
