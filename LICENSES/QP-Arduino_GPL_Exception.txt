QP/C++ and QP-nano FRAMEWORK EXCEPTION FOR ARDUINO

Version 3.0, December 22, 2021

Copyright (c) 2005-2021 Quantum Leaps, LLC. <https://www.state-machine.com/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This QP/C++ and QP-nano Framework Exception for Arduino ("Exception")
is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public
License, version 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to the QP/C++ and QP-nano
source code (the "QP Frameworks") that is distributed as part of the
QP-Arduino Support Package.

When you use QP/C++ or QP-nano Frameworks inside your program, the frameworks'
code is combined with your code of the program. The purpose of this Exception
is to allow non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
QP Frameworks' code covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.
"QP Frameworks" are lightweight real-time event frameworks (RTEFs)
as well as all supporting ports and examples, as distributed from:
<https://www.state-machine.com> and
<https://github.com/QuantumLeaps>

"Arduino-Certified Board" means any board with an Arduino-supported
CPU that bears an official Arduino logo and/or is officially certified
under the Arduino Certified Program
(see <https://www.arduino.cc/en/hardware>).

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler and linker in
executable form suitable for execution by an embedded microcontroller.


1. Grant of Additional Permission
As a special Exception, the copyright holder of QP Frameworks gives you
permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining
the QP Frameworks with your own source code without the requirement
to expose your proprietary source code, provided that all Target Code
will execute on Arduino-Certified Board(s).

2. No Weakening of GPL
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software linking to the QP Framework is
unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the GPLv3 license.
