Version 2.0, 2 August 2022

Copyright (c) 2005-2021 Quantum Leaps, LLC. <https://www.state-machine.com/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This QP/C++ and QP-nano Framework Exception for Arduino ("Exception")
is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public
License, version 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to the QP/C++ and QP-nano
source code (the "QP Frameworks") that is distributed as part of the
QP-Arduino Support Package.

When you use QP Frameworks inside your program, the QP Frameworks' code
is combined with your code of the program. The purpose of this Exception
is to allow non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way,
the QP Frameworks' code covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.
"QP Frameworks" are lightweight real-time embedded frameworks (RTEFs)
as well as all supporting ports and examples, as distributed from:
<https://www.state-machine.com> and
<https://github.com/QuantumLeaps>

"Raspberry Pi" is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that is
designed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation based in the UK and registered
as UK educational charity under the number 1129409. For the purpose of
this license, Raspberry Pi means only genuine Raspberry Pi computer
bearing the Raspberry Pi logo, as described at
<https://www.raspberrypi.com/trademark-rules>.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler and linker in
executable form suitable for execution by Raspberry Pi.


1. Grant of Additional Permission
As a special Exception, the copyright holder of QP Frameworks gives you
permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the QP
Frameworks with your own source code without the requirement to expose
your proprietary source code, provided that all Target Code will execute
on a genuine Raspberry Pi computer(s).

2. No Weakening of GPL
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software linking to the QP Framework is
unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the GPLv3 license.
