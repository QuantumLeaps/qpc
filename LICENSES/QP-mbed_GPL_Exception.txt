Version 2.0, August 2022

Copyright (c) 2005-2014 Quantum Leaps, LLC. <https://www.state-machine.com/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This QP/C++ and QP-nano Framework Exception for Arduino ("Exception")
is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public
License, version 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to the QP/C++ and QP-nano
source code (the "QP Frameworks") that is distributed as part of the
QP-Arduino Support Package.

When you use QP Frameworks inside your program, the QP Frameworks' code
is combined with your code of the program. The purpose of this Exception
is to allow non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way,
the QP Frameworks' code covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.
"QP Frameworks" are lightweight real-time embedded frameworks (RTEFs)
as well as all supporting ports and examples, as distributed from:
<https://www.state-machine.com> and
<https://github.com/QuantumLeaps>

"mbed-Enabled Board" means any board with an ARM Cortex-M CPU that is
listed on the official "mbed platforms" website
<https://os.mbed.com/platforms>.


1. Grant of Additional Permission
As a special Exception, the copyright holder of QP Frameworks gives you
permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining
the QP Frameworks with your own source code without the requirement
to expose your proprietary source code, provided that all Target Code will
execute on an "mbed-Enabled Board".

2. No Weakening of GPL
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software linking to the QP Framework is
unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the GPLv3 license.
