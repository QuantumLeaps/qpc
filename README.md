# About QP/C
QP/C (Quantum Platform in C) is a lightweight, open source
[Real-Time Embedded Framework (RTEF)][RTEF] for building modern embedded
software as systems of asynchronous, event-driven [active objects][Active]
(actors). The [QP/C] framework is a member of a larger [QP] family
consisting of [QP/C], [QP/C++], and [QP-nano] frameworks, which are all
strictly quality controlled, thoroughly documented, and [commercially
licensable][Lic].

## Safer Model of Concurrency
The [QP] framework family is based on the [Active Object][Active] (**actor**)
design pattern, which inherently supports and automatically enforces the
following best practices of concurrent programming:

- Keep data isolated and bound to active objects' threads. Threads should
hide (**encapsulate**) their private data and other resources, and not
share them with the rest of the system.

- Communicate among active object threads **asynchronously** via event
objects. Using asynchronous events keeps the threads running truly
independently, **without blocking** on each other.

- Active object threads should spend their lifetime responding to incoming
events, so their mainline should consist of an **event-loop** that handles
events one at a time (to completion), thus avoiding any concurrency hazards
within an active object thread itself.

This architecture is generally **safer**, more responsive and easier to
understand and maintain than the shared-state concurrency of a conventional
RTOS. It also provides higher level of abstraction and the *correct*
abstractions to effectively apply **modeling** and **code generation** to
deeply embedded real-time systems.

## Hierarchical State Machines
The behavior of active objects is specified in QP/C by means of
[Hierarchical State Machines][HSM] (UML statecharts). The framework
supports manual coding of UML state machines in C as well as automatic
**code generation** by means of the free [QM modeling tool][QM].

## Built-in Real-Time Kernels
The QP/C framework can run on bare-metal single-chip microcontrollers,
completely replacing a traditional RTOS. The framework contains a selection
of **built-in real-time kernels**, such as the cooperative QV kernel, the
preemptive non-blocking QK kernel, and the preemptive, blocking QXK kernel
that provides all the features you might expect from a traditional RTOS.
Native QP ports and ready-to-use examples are provided for major CPUs, such
as ARM Cortex-M (M0/M0+/M3/M4/M7).

## Traditional RTOS/OS
QP/C can also work with a traditional RTOS, such as ThreadX, FreeRTOS, embOS,
uC/OS-II and TI-RTOS, as well as with (embedded) Linux (POSIX) and Windows.

## Maturity
With 60,000 downloads a year, the [QP] family is the most popular such
solution on the embedded software market. It provides a modern, reusable
architecture for embedded applications, which combines the active-object
model of concurrency with hierarchical state machines.

# Getting Started with QP/C
The [QP/C Reference Manual](https://www.state-machine.com/qpc/) provides
instructions on how to download, install, and get started with QP/C quickly.

The [AppNote: "Getting Started with QP/C"][AN] contains also a tutorial,
in which you build a simple "Blinky" application.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# QP/C Licensing
QP/C is licensed under the increasingly popular [dual licensing model][Lic],
in which both the open source software distribution mechanism and
traditional closed source software distribution models are combined.

product, all QP frameworks can be [licensed commercially][Lic], in which case
you don't use any open source license and you do not violate your policy.
