@tableofcontents

<p><a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://www.state-machine.com/qp"><strong>QP/C&trade; (Quantum Platform in C)</strong></a> is a lightweight, open source software framework for building responsive and modular real-time embedded applications as systems of cooperating, event-driven <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://www.state-machine.com/qp/index.php#Active">active objects</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actors</a>). The QP/C&trade; framework is a member of a larger family consisting of QP/C, QP/C++, and QP-nano frameworks, which are all strictly quality controlled, thoroughly documented, and commercially licensable.
</p>

@image html logo_qp.jpg

All QP&trade; frameworks can run on @ref exa_native "bare-metal single-chip microcontrollers", completely replacing a traditional Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). Ports and ready-to-use examples are provided for major @ref exa_ref_mcu "CPU families".

QP/C can also work with many traditional @ref exa_rtos "RTOSes" and @ref exa_rtos "desktop OSes" (such as Windows, Linux including embedded Linux).

The behavior of active objects is specified in QP by means of <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine">hierarchical state machines (UML statecharts)</a>. The frameworks support manual coding of UML state machines in C or C++ as well as fully automatic code generation by means of the free graphical <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://www.state-machine.com/qm/help">QM&trade; modeling tool</a>.

The QP frameworks are used in millions of products worldwide in aerospace, medical devices, consumer electronics, wired and wireless telecommunications, industrial automation, transportation, robotics, and many more. The QP frameworks and the <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://www.state-machine.com/qm/help">QM modeling tool</a> receive over <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/qpc/files/stats/timeline?dates=2014-01-01+to+2014-12-31">40,000 downloads a year</a>. The book, <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://www.state-machine.com/psicc2" >Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++, 2nd Edition</a> provides a detailed design study of the QP frameworks and explains all the related concepts.

@section licensing Licensing QP/C

QP/C is licensed under the increasingly popular <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://www.state-machine.com/licensing">dual licensing model</a>, in which both the open source software distribution mechanism and traditional closed source software distribution models are combined.

@note If your company has a policy forbidding open source in your product, all QP frameworks can be licensed commercially, in which case you don't use any open source license and you do not violate your policy.

@section misra MISRA Compliance

<p>The QP/C framework comply with most of the Motor Industry Software Reliability Association (MISRA) MISRA-C:2004 rules.
</p>

@image html AN_MISRA.jpg "QP/C MISRA-C:2004 Compliance Matrix"

All deviations are carefully limited into very specific contexts and are documented with the Application Note: <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://www.state-machine.com/resources/AN_QP-C_MISRA.pdf"><strong>QP/C MISRA-C:2004 Compliance Matrix</strong></a>.

@note
MISRA and MISRA C are registered trademarks of MIRA Ltd, held on behalf of the MISRA Consortium.

The MISRA guidelines place great emphasis on the use of static code analysts tools to check compliance with the MISRA-C language subset. To this end, QP/C comes with an extensive support for automatic rule checking with @ref misra_lint "PC-Lint". The QP frameworks go even beyond MISRA, by complying with the <strong>strict type checking</strong> of PC-Lint and a very consistent, documented <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://www.state-machine.com/resources/AN_QL_Coding_Standard.pdf" >Quantum Leaps Coding Standard</a>.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@section pc-lint PC-Lint Support

The QP/C framework comes with extensive support for automatic rule checking by means of <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://www.gimpel.com/">PC-Lint</a>, which is designed not just for proving compliance of the Q/CP framework code, but more importantly, to aid in checking compliance of the application-level code. Any organization engaged in designing safety-related embedded software could benefit from the unprecedented quality infrastructure built around the QP/C framework.
