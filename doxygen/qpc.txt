<a href="http://www.state-machine.com/qm/"><strong>QP&trade; (Quantum Platform)</strong></a> is a family of lightweight, open source software frameworks for building responsive and modular real-time embedded applications as systems of cooperating, event-driven <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/qp/index.php#Active">active objects</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actors</a>). The QP&trade; family consists of QP/C, QP/C++, and QP-nano frameworks, which are all strictly quality controlled, superbly documented, and commercially licensable.

\image html qp_components.jpg

All QP&trade; frameworks can run on "bare-metal" single-chip microcontrollers, completely replacing a traditional Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). Ports and ready-to-use examples are provided for most major <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/downloads/index.php#QDK">CPU families</a>. QP/C and QP/C++ can also work with a traditional OS/RTOS, such as: <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/linux/">POSIX (Linux, embedded Linux, QNX, INTEGRITY)</a>, <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/win32/">Windows (Windows embedded, Windows CE)</a>, <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/android/">Android-NDK</a>, <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/threadx/">ThreadX</a>, <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/ucos2/">MicroC/OS</a>, etc.

The behavior of active objects is specified in QP by means of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine">hierarchical state machines (UML statecharts)</a>. The frameworks support manual coding of UML state machines in C or C++ as well as fully automatic code generation by means of the free graphical <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/qm/">QM&trade; modeling tool</a>.

The QP frameworks are used in millions of products worldwide in aerospace, robotics, consumer electronics, wired and wireless telecommunications, industrial automation, transportation, and many more. The QP frameworks and the QM modeling tool receive over <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/qpc/files/stats/timeline?dates=2012-08-28+to+2013-08-28">30,000 downloads a year</a> (not even counting downloads of QP ports).

QP is available for download from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/qpc">SourceForge.net</a>--the world's biggest open source repository. The summary of available downloads is also available from <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/downloads">Quantum Leaps download page</a>.

\section derivation Object-Oriented Programming in C

Even though QP/C is implemented in standard ANSI-C, it extensively uses
object-oriented design principles such as encapsulation (classes) and 
single inheritance. At the C language level, encapsulation and inheritance
become just simple coding idioms, which this section briefly describes.

<b>Encapsulation</b> is the ability to package data with operations into
<b>classes</b>. In C, you represent the data as a \c struct and the 
operations that use this data as functions that take a pointer to the
\c struct as the first argument. For example, the "class" \c ::QMsm
packages the state machine data with the functions that operate on this
data. The declaration of this class in C is as follows:
 
\code
typedef struct QMsmTag {
    QMsmVtbl const *vptr;                       
    QMAttr state;         
    QMAttr temp; 
} QMsm;

void QMsm_ctor(QMsm * const me, QStateHandler initial);
void QMsm_init(QMsm * const me, QEvt const * const e);
void QMsm_dispatch(QMsm * const me, QEvt const * const e);
\endcode

As you can see, QP/C applies a number of coding and naming conventions
to further strenghten the association between the data struct and the
functions that operate on it:

- the struct holding the class attributes is typedef'ed to the
class name, for convenience of accessing it as \c QMsm instead of
\c struct \c QMsm.

- each class function starts with the prefix \c QMsm_ to make it
clear that the function belongs to the class

- each class function takes the pointer to the \c QMsm \c struct as the
<i>first</i> argument, which is always called <b>me</b>

- the class provides a special function for initialization of the
attributes, which is called \c QMsm_ctor, because it plays the role
of a class <i>constructor</i>.  
         
      
<b>Inheritance</b> is the ability to derive new classes based on existing
classes in order to reuse and organize code. You can implement single
inheritance in C very simply by literally embedding the base struct as the
first member of the derived struct. For example, \ref FA1 "Figure 1"(a)
shows the struct ScoreEvt derived from the base struct QEvt by
embedding the QEvt instance as the first member of ScoreEvt. To make this
idiom better stand out, in QP the base struct member is always named <b>super</b>.

\anchor FA1 \image html FA1.jpg "Figure 1 (a) Derivation of structures in C, (b) memory alignment, and (c) the UML class diagram."

As shown in \ref FA1 "Figure 1"(b), such nesting of structs always aligns
the data member \c super at the beginning of every instance of the derived
struct. In particular, this alignment lets you treat a pointer to the
derived \c ScoreEvt struct as a pointer to the \c QEvt base struct.
Consequently, you can always safely pass a pointer to \c ScoreEvt to any C
function that expects a pointer to \c QEvt. (To be strictly correct in C, you
should explicitly cast this pointer. In OOP such casting is called upcasting
and is always safe.) Therefore, all functions designed for the \c QEvt
"class" are automatically available to the ScoreEvt "class" as well as
other "classes" derived from \c QEvt. \ref FA1 "Figure 1"(c) shows the UML
class diagram depicting the inheritance relationship between \c ScoreEvt and
\c QEvt classes.

QP uses single inheritance quite extensively not just for derivation of events
with parameters, but also for derivation of state machines and active objects.
Of course, the C++ version of QP uses the native C++ support for class
inheritance rather than "derivation of structures".
