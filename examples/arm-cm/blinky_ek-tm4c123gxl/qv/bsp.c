/*****************************************************************************
* NOTE00:
* The QF_AWARE_ISR_CMSIS_PRI constant from the QF port specifies the highest
* ISR priority that is disabled by the QF framework. The value is suitable
* for the NVIC_SetPriority() CMSIS function.
*
* Only ISRs prioritized at or below the QF_AWARE_ISR_CMSIS_PRI level (i.e.,
* with the numerical values of priorities equal or higher than
* QF_AWARE_ISR_CMSIS_PRI) are allowed to call any QF services. These ISRs
* are "QF-aware".
*
* Conversely, any ISRs prioritized above the QF_AWARE_ISR_CMSIS_PRI priority
* level (i.e., with the numerical values of priorities less than
* QF_AWARE_ISR_CMSIS_PRI) are never disabled and are not aware of the kernel.
* Such "QF-unaware" ISRs cannot call any QF services. The only mechanism
* by which a "QF-unaware" ISR can communicate with the QF framework is by
* triggering a "QF-aware" ISR, which can post/publish events.
*
* NOTE01:
* The QV_onIdle() callback is called with interrupts disabled, because the
* determination of the idle condition might change by any interrupt posting
* an event. QV_onIdle() must internally enable interrupts, ideally
* atomically with putting the CPU to the power-saving mode.
*
* NOTE02:
* One of the LEDs is used to visualize the idle loop activity. The brightness
* of the LED is proportional to the frequency of invcations of the idle loop.
* Please note that the LED is toggled with interrupts locked, so no interrupt
* execution time contributes to the brightness of the User LED.
