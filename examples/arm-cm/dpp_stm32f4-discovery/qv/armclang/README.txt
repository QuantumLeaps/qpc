About this Example
==================
This example demonstrates how to use the uVision IDE together with
the MDK-ARM toolchain.

uVision Project File
====================
The MDK-ARM uVision project file provided with this example uses
relative paths to the QP/C framework location (includes, port, and
libraries. These relative paths must be modified when the project
is moved to different relative location.


Adjusting Stack and Heap Sizes
==============================
The stack and heap sizes are determined in this project by the 
command-line options for the ARM assembler (see the Asm tab in
the "Options for Target" dialog box in uVision). Specifically,
you should define symbols: Stack_Size=xxx Heap_Size=yyy, where
xxx represents a numerical value of stack size and yyy the
numberical value of the heap size (for most embedded projects
yyy should be 0, as the using the heap is not recommended).
