# This is an example of QView customization for a specific application
# (DPP in this case). This example animates the Phil images on the
# QView canvas. Additionally, there is a button in the middle of the screen,
# which, when clicked once pauses the DPP ("forks" are not being served).
# A second click on the button, "un-pauses" the DPP ("forks" are served
# to all hungry Philosophers).
#
# This version of the DPP customization uses the predefined QS_QEP_TRAN
# trace record, which provides information about the state transitions of
# the Dining Philosophers. The example also demonstrates how to intercept
# the QS "dictionary" records QS_OBJ_DICT and QS_FUN_DICT to extract the
# information about the addresses of the Philosopher objects and the states
# of their state machines.
#
# NOTE: this is a desktop appliction, which you cannot reset (and restarted).
# Therefore, the desktop applications must be started *after* the QView is
# already running and is attached to the QSPY host application.
