About This Example
==================
This example is loosely based on Matt Chernosky's blog "Test-Driving
with Mocks Instead of Hardware", which you can find at:
http://www.electronvector.com/blog/test-driving-with-mocks-instead-of-hardware
https://vimeo.com/256590562

The purpose is to illustrate the simpler alternative to building Mocks with
QUTest.

*** NOTE ***
The provided Makefiles for building and running the tests are cross-platform
and will work on Windows as well as POSIX workstations (Linux/MacOS). Also,
it is assumed that you have installed the QTools collection on your computer
and that you have added the QTools/bin directory to your PATH, see:
   https://www.state-machine.com/qtools

Building the Code and Testing with Unity
----------------------------------------
Open a terminal/command-prompt. Change directory to test_unity
(qpc/examples/qutest/unity_mock/test_unity).

Type "make". The provided Makefile will build the code and run
the tests using the Unity framework.

*** NOTE ***
For Windows, the make utility, the C compiler (MinGW) are included
in the QTools collection. For all platforms, you will also need
the Unity source code, which is also included in the QTools collection
and the provided Makefile takes it from there.

*** NOTE *** 
Some of the Unity tests fail, which is intentional to demonstrate
various failure modes.


Building the Code and Testing with QUTest
-----------------------------------------
Open terminal / command-prompt and launch the QSPY host utility
by typing:

qspy -u -t

Open *another* terminal / command-prompt and change directory to
test (qpc/examples/qutest/unity_mock/test).
Type:

make

to build the code with the provided Makefile and run the tests
using the Tcl test script (test_LedBar.tcl)

*** NOTE ***
For Windows, the Tcl interpreter (tclsh 8.4) with the UDP extension
is included in the QTools collection, so you don't need to install
any additional software to run the Tcl tests. For other operating
systems (Linux/MacOS), Tcl is typically provided, but you need to
install the UDP extension, as described at:
https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/start.html#qtools_qspypy

*** NOTE *** 
Some of the QUTest tests fail, which is intentional to demonstrate
various failure modes, exactly as it is in the case of Unity tests.


If you prefer to use Python, add "SCRIPT=py" parameter to make:

make SCRIPT=py

this will build the code and run the tests
using the Python test script (test_LedBar.py)

*** NOTE *** 
In order to run the Python tests, you need to install Python on
your machine. Additionally, you need to enable Python support for
QUTest unit testing, as described at:
https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/start.html#qtools_qspypy
