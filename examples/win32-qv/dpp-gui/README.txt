The Win32 GUI emulation of the Dining Philosopher Problem (DPP) example
is now located in the directory:

examples\arm-cm\dpp_ek-tm4c123gxl\win32-qv\

This co-location of the Win32 emulation with the embedded code running
on the actual embedded board demonstrates better the "dual targeting"
development approach.
