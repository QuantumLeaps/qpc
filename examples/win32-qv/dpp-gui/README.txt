The Win32-QV GUI emulation of the Dining Philosopers Problem (DPP) example
for the EFM32-SLSTK3401A board from Silicon Labs is now located in the
directory:

examples\arm-cm\dpp_efm32-slstk3401a\win32-qv\


This co-location of the Win32 emulation with the embedded code running
on the actual board demonstrates better the "dual targeting" development
approach.
