The Win32 GUI emulation of the "Fly 'n' Shoot" game example for the
EK-LM3S811 board is now located in the directory:

examples\arm-cm\game_ek-lm3s811\win32\

This co-location of the Win32 emulation with the embedded code running
on the actual board demonstrates better the "dual targeting" development
approach.
