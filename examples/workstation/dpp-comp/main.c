/*****************************************************************************
* NOTE1:
* Windows is not a deterministic real-time system, which means that the
* system can occasionally and unexpectedly "choke and freeze" for a number
* of seconds. The designers of Windows have dealt with these sort of issues
* by massively oversizing the resources available to the applications. For
* example, the default Windows GUI message queues size is 10,000 entries,
* which can dynamically grow to an even larger number. Also the stacks of
* Win32 threads can dynamically grow to several megabytes.
*
* In contrast, the event queues, event pools, and stack size inside the
* real-time embedded (RTE) systems can be (and must be) much smaller,
* because you typically can put an upper bound on the real-time behavior
* and the resulting delays.
*
* To be able to run the unmodified applications designed originally for
* RTE systems on Windows, and to reduce the odds of resource shortages in
* this case, the generous WIN_FUDGE_FACTOR is used to oversize the
* event queues and event pools.
