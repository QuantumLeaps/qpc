/**
* @description
* Time events are special QF events equipped with the notion of time passage.
* The basic usage model of the time events is as follows. An active object
* allocates one or more ::QTimeEvt objects (provides the storage for them).
* When the active object needs to arrange for a timeout, it arms one of its
* time events to fire either just once (one-shot) or periodically. Each time
* event times out independently from the others, so a QF application can make
* multiple parallel timeout requests (from the same or different active
* objects). When QF detects that the appropriate moment has arrived, it
* inserts the time event directly into the recipient's event queue. The
* recipient then processes the time event just like any other event.
*
* Time events, as any other QF events derive from the ::QEvt base structure.
* Typically, you will use a time event as-is, but you can also further
* derive more specialized time events from it by adding some more data
* members and/or specialized functions that operate on the specialized
* time events.
*
* Internally, the armed time events are organized into linked lists--one list
* for every supported ticking rate. These linked lists are scanned in every
* invocation of the QF_tickX_() function. Only armed (timing out) time events
* are in the list, so only armed time events consume CPU cycles.
*
* @sa ::QTimeEvt for the description of the data members @n @ref oop
*
* @note
* QF manages the time events in the function QF_tickX_(), which must be called
* periodically, from the clock tick ISR or from the special ::QTicker
* active object.
*
* @note
* Even though ::QTimeEvt is a subclass of ::QEvt, ::QTimeEvt instances can NOT
* be allocated dynamically from event pools. In other words, it is illegal to
* allocate ::QTimeEvt instances with the Q_NEW() or Q_NEW_X() macros.
