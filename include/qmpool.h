* @description
* A fixed block-size memory pool is a very fast and efficient data
* structure for dynamic allocation of fixed block-size chunks of memory.
* A memory pool offers fast and deterministic allocation and recycling of
* memory blocks and is not subject to fragmenation.@n
* @n
* The ::QMPool class describes the native QF memory pool, which can be used as
* the event pool for dynamic event allocation, or as a fast, deterministic
* fixed block-size heap for any other objects in your application.
*
* @note
* ::QMPool contains only data members for managing a memory pool, but
* does not contain the pool storage, which must be provided externally
* during the pool initialization.
*
* @note
* The native QF event pool is configured by defining the macro
* #QF_EPOOL_TYPE_ as ::QMPool in the specific QF port header file.
