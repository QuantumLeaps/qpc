/**
* @description
* QV_onIdle() is called by the cooperative QV kernel (from QF_run()) when
* the scheduler detects that no events are available for active objects
* (the idle condition). This callback gives the application an opportunity
* to enter a power-saving CPU mode, or perform some other idle processing
* (such as QS software tracing output).
*
* @note QV_onIdle() is invoked with interrupts DISABLED because the idle
* condition can be asynchronously changed at any time by an interrupt.
* QV_onIdle() MUST enable the interrupts internally, but not before
* putting the CPU into the low-power mode. (Ideally, enabling interrupts and
* low-power mode should happen atomically). At the very least, the function
* MUST enable interrupts, otherwise interrupts will remain disabled
* permanently.
*
* @note QV_onIdle() is only used by the cooperative QV kenrnel in the
* native (bare metal) QF ports, and is NOT used in any other QF ports. When
* QF is combined with the preemptive QK, the QK idle loop calls a different
* function QK_onIdle(), with different semantics than QV_onIdle(). When QF
* is combined with a 3rd-party RTOS or kernel, the idle processing mechanism
* of the RTOS or kernel is used instead of QV_onIdle().
