* The customization of the thread occurs in the QXThread_ctor(), where you
* provide the thred-handler function as the parameter.

/*! Blocking Mutex the QXK preemptive kernel */
/**
* @description
* ::QXMutex is a blocking mutual exclusion mechanism that can also apply
* the **priority ceiling protocol** to avoid unbounded priority inversion
* (if initialized with a non-zero ceiling priority, see QXMutex_init()).
* In that case, ::QXMutex requires its own uinque QP priority level, which
* cannot be used by any thread or any other ::QXMutex.
* If initialzied with zero ceiling priority, ::QXMutex does **not** use the
* priority ceiling protocol and does not require a unique QP priority
* (see QXMutex_init()).
* ::QXMutex is **recursive** (reentrant), which means that it can be locked
* mutiliple times (up to 255 levels) by the *same* thread without causing
* deadlock.
* ::QXMutex is primarily intended for the @ref ::QXThread
* "extened (blocking) threads", but can also be used by the @ref ::QActive
* "basic threads" through the non-blocking QXMutex_tryLock() API.
*
* @note
* ::QXMutex should be used in situations when at least one of the extended
* threads contending for the mutex blocks while holding the mutex (between
* the QXMutex_lock() and QXMutex_unlock() operations). If no blocking is
* needed while holding the mutex, the more efficient non-blocking mechanism
* of @ref QXK_schedLock() "selective QXK scheduler locking" should be used
* instead. @ref QXK_schedLock() "Selective scheduler locking" is available
* for both @ref ::QActive "basic threads" and @ref ::QXThread "extended
* threads", so it is applicable to situations where resources are shared
* among all these threads.
