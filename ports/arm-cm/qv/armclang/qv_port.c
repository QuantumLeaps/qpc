* Initialize the exception priorities and IRQ priorities to safe values.

* Description:
* On Cortex-M3/M4/M7, this QV port disables interrupts by means of the
* BASEPRI register. However, this method cannot disable interrupt
* priority zero, which is the default for all interrupts out of reset.
* The following code changes the SysTick priority and all IRQ priorities
* to the safe value QF_BASEPRI, wich the QF critical section can disable.
* This avoids breaching of the QF critical sections in case the
* application programmer forgets to explicitly set priorities of all
* "kernel aware" interrupts.
*
* The interrupt priorities established in QV_init() can be later
* changed by the application-level code.
