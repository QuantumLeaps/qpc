This QP port to POSIX with P-threads is intended for building
multithreaded QP applications running on embedded POSIX targets.

If you are interested in using a POSIX host for testing your
embedded QP applications, consider the following QP ports:

- posix-qutest  for running QUTest unit testing harness
- posix-qv      single-threaded QP port to POSIX


NOTE:
Building of the QP libraries on the POSIX targets or hosts
is no longer necessary. The example projects for POSIX are
built directly from QP source files and don't need a library.
