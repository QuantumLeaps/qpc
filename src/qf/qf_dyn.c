*
* @attention
* You might initialize many event pools by making many consecutive calls
* to the QF_poolInit() function. However, for the simplicity of the internal
* implementation, you must initialize event pools in the **ascending order**
* of the event size.
*
* Many RTOSes provide fixed block-size heaps, a.k.a. memory pools that can
* be adapted for QF event pools. In case such support is missing, QF provides
* a native QF event pool implementation. The macro #QF_EPOOL_TYPE_ determines
* the type of event pool used by a particular QF port. See structure ::QMPool
* for more information.
*
* @note The actual number of events available in the pool might be actually
* less than (@p poolSize / @p evtSize) due to the internal alignment
* of the blocks that the pool might perform. You can always check the
* capacity of the pool by calling QF_getPoolMin().
*
* @note The dynamic allocation of events is optional, meaning that you
* might choose not to use dynamic events. In that case calling QF_poolInit()
* and using up memory for the memory blocks is unnecessary.

* @description
* This function implements a simple garbage collector for the dynamic events.
* Only dynamic events are candidates for recycling. (A dynamic event is one
* that is allocated from an event pool, which is determined as non-zero
* e->poolId_ attribute.) Next, the function decrements the reference counter
* of the event (e->refCtr_), and recycles the event only if the counter drops
* to zero (meaning that no more references are outstanding for this event).
* The dynamic event is recycled by returning it to the pool from which
* it was originally allocated.
*
* @param[in]  e  pointer to the event to recycle
*
* @note
* QF invokes the garbage collector at all appropriate contexts, when
* an event can become garbage (automatic garbage collection), so the
* application code should have no need to call QF_gc() directly. The QF_gc()
* function is exposed only for special cases when your application sends
* dynamic events to the "raw" thread-safe queues (see ::QEQueue). Such
* queues are processed outside of QF and the automatic garbage collection
* is **NOT** performed for these events. In this case you need to call
* QF_gc() explicitly.
