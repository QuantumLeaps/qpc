* @description
* Initialize a fixed block-size memory pool by providing it with the pool
* memory to manage, size of this memory, and the block size.
*
* @param[in,out] me       pointer (see @ref oop)
* @param[in]     poolSto  pointer to the memory buffer for pool storage
* @param[in]     poolSize size of the storage buffer in bytes
* @param[in]     blockSize fixed-size of the memory blocks in bytes
*
* @attention
* The caller of QMPool::init() must make sure that the @p poolSto
* pointer is properly **aligned**. In particular, it must be possible to
* efficiently store a pointer at the location pointed to by @p poolSto.
* Internally, the QMPool_init() function rounds up the block size
* @p blockSize so that it can fit an integer number of pointers.
* This is done to achieve proper alignment of the blocks within the pool.
*
* @note
* Due to the rounding of block size the actual capacity of the pool might
* be less than (@p poolSize / @p blockSize). You can check the capacity
* of the pool by calling the QF_getPoolMin() function.
*
* @note
* This function is **not** protected by a critical section, because
* it is intended to be called only during the initialization of the system,
* when interrupts are not allowed yet.
*
* @note
* Many QF ports use memory pools to implement the event pools.

* The following example illustrates how to invoke QMPool_init():
* @include qmp_init.c
