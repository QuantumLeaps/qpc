* @description
* This function initializes the publish-subscribe facilities of QF and must
* be called exactly once before any subscriptions/publications occur in
* the application.
*
* @param[in] subscrSto pointer to the array of subscriber lists
* @param[in] maxSignal the dimension of the subscriber array and at
*                      the same time the maximum signal that can be published
*                      or subscribed.
*
* The array of subscriber-lists is indexed by signals and provides a mapping
* between the signals and subscriber-lists. The subscriber-lists are bitmasks
* of type ::QSubscrList, each bit in the bit mask corresponding to the unique
* priority of an active object. The size of the ::QSubscrList bit mask
* depends on the value of the #QF_MAX_ACTIVE macro.
*
* @note
* The publish-subscribe facilities are optional, meaning that you might
* choose not to use publish-subscribe. In that case calling QF_psInit()
* and using up memory for the subscriber-lists is unnecessary.
*
* @sa ::QSubscrList
*
* @usage
* The following example shows the typical initialization sequence of QF:

* active objects that have subscribed to the signal @a e->sig, which is
* called _multicasting_. The multicasting performed in this function is
* very efficient based on reference-counting inside the published event
* ("zero-copy" event multicasting). This function is designed to be
* callable from any part of the system, including ISRs, device drivers,
* and active objects.
*
* @note
* To avoid any unexpected re-ordering of events posted into AO queues,
* the event multicasting is performed with scheduler __locked__. However,
* the scheduler is locked only up to the priority level of the highest-
* priority subscriber, so any AOs of even higher priority, which did not
* subscribe to this event are _not_ affected.
